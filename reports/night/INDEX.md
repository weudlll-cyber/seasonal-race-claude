# Night blocks — index

Unattended blocks: one file per block, newest first. These are lab-journal entries and are
**append-only** — a report records what was true on the day it was written and is never rewritten.

This index exists because `reports/night/` sat outside every guard until ONE-TRUTH-2 stage 5: a
report here could be orphaned, or an index link could dangle, with nothing noticing.
`node scripts/check-index.mjs --dir=reports/night --index=reports/night/INDEX.md` now checks both
directions.

- [LABEL-SHRINK-1.md](LABEL-SHRINK-1.md) — smaller labels only where they would otherwise collide, and
  **it works**: zero overlaps at every field size on all ten tracks, zero formations touched that did
  not need it, floor never reached. The factor is closed-form from the formation's own geometry
  (0.896 garden-path / 0.805 mountainstreet / 0.696 river-run); smallest anywhere 0.696 against a
  0.6 floor, so **headroom is 0.096** — one denser racer type from needing proposal A. Two things to
  read before minting: requirement (f) is **NOT met** (26.1% size step between 72 and 73 racers,
  because the START GRID steps there, 3x24 -> 4x19 — every way of smoothing it breaks "only where
  necessary"); and proving rule (c) exposed that **the render fingerprint harness draws NAMELESS
  racers**, so the hash moves for all ten tracks while only three change in the browser. Rule (c)
  itself is proven byte-exact: with the shrink bypassed the branch reproduces master's combined AND
  per-track hashes exactly.
- [LABEL-STAGGER-1.md](LABEL-STAGGER-1.md) — one rule for every track, and **the half of it that does
  not work**. The TRIGGER shipped and is exact — across all ten tracks at every field size it fires on
  0 formations with no overlap and misses 0 that have one — but the rule as specified could not be
  implemented: comparing row separation against the label's HEIGHT fires 153 times where nothing
  overlaps, because a label is a rectangle and two of them miss on either axis. The PLACEMENT did not
  ship: four variants measured (row parity at one and two box heights, greedy by screen order at two
  and six levels) and none reaches zero — it is not vertical room, six levels is no better than two.
  A whole-row stagger walks the collision into the next row and CREATES overlaps, proved on a probe.
  Render fingerprint deliberately UNCHANGED, which is the evidence that nothing moved. Found on the
  way: mountainstreet also overlaps (33 field sizes) — the first ten-track sweep; and the rule
  toggles on and off between adjacent racer counts, 17 times on mountainstreet.
- [DOC-ORDER-1.md](DOC-ORDER-1.md) — documentation a stranger could actually be handed. The evidence
  for his own suspicion that most documents were never asked for: twenty of fifty-three were the
  by-product of one work session and had had no substantive change since a bulk German-to-English
  translation pass in May — they are now in `docs/archive/`, whose first line says nothing there is
  current. A three-tier map (the project · how we work · history) replaces an index that listed 15 of
  51 documents. New: `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, which caught three words that each mean two unrelated things
  (corridor, band, pulk). The two-year test was run for real and **failed one of three questions** —
  the fixed points lived only in tier 2, so `PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md` now owns them — and it failed on
  step ONE, because the README told a newcomer the wrong dev-server port, as did four other places
  including a live backlog recommendation. Six weakest spots named; BACKLOG/ROADMAP still half-own a
  subject and that is the bluntest of them.
- [START-FORMATION-1.md](START-FORMATION-1.md) — the start formation, from his eye test. Names now
  draw LAST, after every sprite, so no racer can cover one — render fingerprint moved (expected, the
  order is what it hashes), camera unchanged, world not run and not needed; his eye PASSED, so it was minted
  (render cf716cbdf37b2077) and merged as 81f9b908; return point `pre/start-formation`. The label overlap on river-run is NOT lateral crowding: every overlapping pair,
  on every track, at every racer count, is between neighbouring START ROWS, and the row gap follows
  the racer type's `displaySize`. Swept every count from 2 to the full grid on his instruction —
  river-run fails 56 of 99, the other three fail none. Also found: the start has NO framing rule,
  COUNTDOWN is absent from the six-state table. Four routes for the overlap, none implemented.
- [MERGE-AND-GUARD-1.md](MERGE-AND-GUARD-1.md) — merge what is ready, then the next one-truth target.
  CONFIG-TRUTH-1 and the owner's backup tool merged to master (merge commits, containment proved);
  the backup tool RUN and confirmed at its documented 247 files / 12.0 MB, `--minimal` still dropping
  exactly `sessions.sqlite`. Rebase merging disabled — merge commits are now the only way in. The
  fairness threshold gets one home in `docs/FAIRNESS.md` (19 restatements → 0). **The track-count
  check was built, run and ABANDONED as unbuildable** — the evidence is in the guard's header, and
  R11 now records that abandoning a guard is a legitimate outcome. Nine config claims found that
  CONFIG-TRUTH-1's narrower shape had missed. CI still owed: the Actions outage ran all evening,
  though the new `workflow_dispatch` hand crank does now create runs.
- [CONFIG-TRUTH-1.md](CONFIG-TRUTH-1.md) — the owner's values land, and documents stop stating
  numbers. 94 current config claims across 11 living documents → 0, enforced by
  `check-config-claims.mjs` in CI, the commit hook and verify; nine archives now declare themselves
  HISTORICAL. Squash merging disabled at repo level (rebase still on — his call).
  `minRacersVisible` 3 → 5 hit its stop rule: it moves the camera fingerprint AND the render one, so
  it sits unmerged and unminted on its own branch awaiting the ceremony and his eye. The
  `choreoOutcomeStart` premise verified three ways from history. CI on master still owed — the
  GitHub Actions outage ran all evening.
- [CLEAN-STATE-1.md](CLEAN-STATE-1.md) — merge, then one green master with no loose ends. The three
  ONE-TRUTH branches merged as merge commits (a squash would have destroyed the SHA a stamp names),
  three branches deleted, tracking-lag re-measured independently and reproducing cell for cell. A
  wrapper so an ad-hoc helper can prove its edit landed — and the line-ending trap its own sabotage
  found. A test that wrote the TRACKED SIM.md fixed at the cause, not with a retry. Lessons 205 and 206. Config contradictions: seven keys stated as current and wrong, five of them in one document —
  findings only, nothing changed. CI on master unproven: GitHub Actions outage.
- [ONE-TRUTH-2.md](ONE-TRUTH-2.md) — one home, references everywhere else. The owner’s rule:
  all 19 generated fingerprint copies DELETED, documents reference the record or say nothing. The
  containment guard ONE-TRUTH-1 discarded as unsound is now sound and built. Retries to zero, ten
  clean runs. Two silent traps made loud: a swallowed CLI flag and a write that did not land.
- [ONE-TRUTH-1.md](ONE-TRUTH-1.md) — one fact, one home. The three fingerprints got a single
  machine-readable record and 19 documented copies were machine-written and machine-checked.
  Superseded by ONE-TRUTH-2, which deleted all 19 copies instead. Also: the 20-run retry study that
  found the suite failing 3 runs in 10, and the generated engine-reach list in SIM.md.
- [NIGHT-TOOLS-1.md](NIGHT-TOOLS-1.md) — instrument truth. The retry ledger, check-index's second
  direction, the generated ceremony cost column, and the pixel and documentation audits below.
- [E-doc-audit.md](E-doc-audit.md) — the documentation audit from NIGHT-TOOLS-1 stage E.
- [D-pixel-audit.md](D-pixel-audit.md) — the pixel audit from NIGHT-TOOLS-1 stage D.

**Not indexed, and deliberately:** `captures/` holds verbatim BEFORE snapshots taken so a tool's
output could be compared after it changed. They are evidence, not reports, and `check-index` does
not descend into subdirectories.
