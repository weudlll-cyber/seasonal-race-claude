# RaceArena — Architecture

## Overview

RaceArena is currently a self-contained React client. All race logic runs in the browser; all persistence uses `localStorage`. A backend server is planned for Phase 5 (see below).

## Data Flow (current)

```
Browser → React (screens/)
            ↓ Canvas (RaceScreen / TrackEditor)  ← modules/race-engine (rAF tick)
            ↓ localStorage (modules/storage/)    ← all settings, tracks, results
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Pure client for Phases 1–4** — no server dependency. All race state, track geometry, player settings, and results persist in `localStorage` under `racearena:*` keys. See [TRACK_EDITOR.md — localStorage Keys](TRACK_EDITOR.md#localstorage-keys) for the key schema.
- **modules/ are framework-agnostic** — no React imports in `modules/`; screens own the component tree, modules own the logic.
- **Track Editor (Phase 2.5)** — Tracks are authored visually on top of background images. Geometry is stored as inner/outer boundary curves (Catmull-Rom interpolated). See `docs/TRACK_EDITOR.md`.
- **Track Effects replace Environments** — Animated overlays (rain, stars, bubbles, etc.) are opt-in per-track effect layers under `modules/track-effects/`. Up to 3 simultaneous effects per geometry. The old `environments/` module was deleted.
- **Inline draw helpers in RaceScreen** — `drawEditorBackground` and `drawEditorTrackSurface` are currently inlined in `RaceScreen/index.jsx`. Candidate for extraction into `modules/track-renderer/` in a future cleanup PR.

## Future: Phase 5 Server

A backend will be built in Phase 5 with the following responsibilities:

- **Race-outcome authority** — server finalises and signs race results; client is display-only
- **Leaderboard & seasons** — race outcomes written to a persistent DB; season standings computed server-side
- **Socket.IO event streaming** — server broadcasts authoritative race-tick state; replaces the current client-only physics loop for multiplayer
- **Tech stack (planned):** Node.js / Express, Socket.IO, SQLite (single-server) or Postgres (scaled), JWT session tokens with bcrypt

The Phase 5 server will be a fresh implementation designed around race integrity. The original server scaffold (user-auth REST) was deleted in F16 as architecturally incompatible with this model.
