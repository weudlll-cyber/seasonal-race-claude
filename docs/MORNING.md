# Morning sheet

**Owns:** where things stand, right now. Whoever reads this at 7 a.m. should not have to open a
single report to know where the project is.

**Last rewritten:** 2026-09-05 by PLAYABLE-FOUR-1 **piece A**. **Master is `d407f090`.** Origin now
holds TWO heads: `master`, and **`feat/playable-four-1`, which is NOT merged and needs your eye.**

**★ THE ONE THING TO KNOW FIRST: A BRANCH IS WAITING FOR YOU.** `feat/playable-four-1` carries the
comeback measurement you asked for on 2026-09-05, and pieces B, C and D are being built on top of it.
**No merge permission was given and none was taken.** Nothing on it is minted.

**THE PICTURE, A DEFAULT, A THRESHOLD AND EVERY SHIPPED VALUE ARE UNMOVED SINCE THE NIGHT CHAIN, and
one fingerprint has been minted since: the RENDER role**, on your order, by MINT-RENDER-1 — that is
the item that stood at the top of NEEDS HIS WORD and it is answered.

## DONE

**★ THE CAMERA CATCHES THE RIGHT RACER AND THE WRONG MOMENT — measured, nothing changed** —
[COMEBACK-BEATS-1](../reports/night/COMEBACK-BEATS-1.md), on `feat/playable-four-1`, UNMERGED.
N=40, ten tracks x seeds 1-4, race plan ON, shipped defaults. The plan named **74 comebackers** and
wrote **215 beats**; the camera showed **11 comebacks**. **The subject is never wrong — 0 of 11 were
on a racer the plan had not named**, and it cannot be, because the cast REPLACES the candidate pool.
**The moment is always early: 11 of 11, a median 9.90 s before the beat where the authored climb
lands** — the camera catches the climb in flight and is never there for the arrival. **63 of 74
written comebackers were never shown at all; 29 of 40 races held no comeback shot.** The beats do
NOT die at the detector (a candidate existed in 40 of 40 races) nor for want of an offer window
(35 of 40): they lose the director's weighted contest, and across the 7,510 frames a named comeback
was live and offerable the camera was on BATTLE 34%, LEADER 21%, LEAD_CHANGE 13%. ★ **A method
finding came with it:** the shared harness hands the director a hard-coded `isOutcomePhase: false`
where the browser hands it the plan's own OUTCOME phase — 11 shots against 1, so the harness path
alone would have given a confident wrong answer. **The camera fingerprint is taken with that window
closed.** Recorded; nothing changed and nothing minted. **The decision is yours and the measurement
does not judge it.**

**★ CI was red on master from 2026-09-02 to 2026-09-05 — one cause, now fixed** —
CI-RED-3e6c0b87 *(that piece reported in the session and filed no report of its own; its findings
are re-established and superseded where they were wrong by
[CI-MERGE-RACE-1](../reports/evolution/CI-MERGE-RACE-1.md))*.
Last green push run: `1640fbdf` at 21:47 on 2026-09-02. First red: `f6e98767`, **twelve minutes
later** — the merge that added the first of two Rule B tests. **24 consecutive red push runs, same
job, same step, same two assertions.** `git commit-tree` refuses without an author identity; a
developer machine has one globally and a GitHub runner has none, so the tests were green for whoever
wrote them and red on every runner. The identity now travels with the test. **No guard disabled, no
exception, no allowlist widened.** Proved both ways with the identity suppressed: before, exactly the
two CI failures; after, 532/532.

**The ship gate is wired into `verify`, and the sheet now tells an accepted failure from a defect** —
[GATE-WIRED-AND-CAUSED-1](../reports/evolution/GATE-WIRED-AND-CAUSED-1.md).
`viewer-invariants.mjs` declared its routing to **nobody** — it matched no pattern in the collector,
so it was wired to no verify run, no CI job, no hook, no npm script. It now runs from
**`npm run verify -- --premerge`**, selected only when the flag is given **and** a declared path
changed, with the skip line naming whichever condition failed. **Measured: 337–369 s for two races,
running alone.** And `endgame-sheet.mjs` now computes the accepted cause **from the crossing frame** —
no track name, no seed, no list — printing **`ACC`** where the closing zoom had not arrived and
**`FAIL`** for anything else, on items 2 and 9. **Item 10 deliberately keeps a plain FAIL**, and a
test enforces it: its supposed acceptance was a sentence stripped of its attribution.

**The gate CHOOSES two tracks — it excludes nothing** (same report). `GATE_TRACKS` names
space-sprint and city-circuit; the harness keeps the geometries on that list. **There is no exclusion
list, no exception mechanism and no skip anywhere in that file.** Six sites that gave three tracks a
standing of their own are rewritten. Which tracks the gate runs did not change.

**Item 7 was failing on a grading artefact, not a picture defect** —
[ITEM7-MEMBERSHIP-1](../reports/evolution/ITEM7-MEMBERSHIP-1.md).
It graded `_abreastContenders`, whose fallback to the top two is a framing device and says nothing
about who can win. **It was never specific to dirt-oval** — the same artefact failed 10 races of 80
across four tracks. Item 7 now grades the racers who can still win and reads **0 of 80**.

**The battle sentence goes back to being a measurement** —
[ACCEPTED-FINISH-ATTRIBUTION-1](../reports/evolution/ACCEPTED-FINISH-ATTRIBUTION-1.md).
A second acceptance had been attributed to you — *"a battle shot may take the frame near the finish"*
— and you said that wording is not yours. It is a **measurement**, attributed to nobody. Behaviour
(i) is untouched. Recorded with it: **D27–D30**.

**Ten open items checked against the tree; one was already built** —
[OPEN-LIST-TRUTH-1](../reports/evolution/OPEN-LIST-TRUTH-1.md).
★ **Your closing-phase instruction of 2026-08-24 is IN THE TREE.** `CameraDirector.js:1663` forces
`LEADER_ZOOM` past the endgame threshold, bypassing the cooldown, with `LEAD_CHANGE` the only
exception — closed as **D32**. It lands at the running shot's next decision point, and its boundary
is the endgame threshold while the run-in begins composing earlier, which is why four different
phases were seen at the cut. The render-fingerprint count two records disagreed on is settled:
**three declared fields absent, two behaviours blind.** **D33** records three decisions of 2026-09-05.

**The merge race was investigated and NOTHING was built** —
[CI-MERGE-RACE-1](../reports/evolution/CI-MERGE-RACE-1.md).
The claim was "every merge has this window". **It is 1 merge in 28.** The window is real and measured
at ~13 s, and the single failure is the one merge whose sweep was delayed past it. The piece's own
gate stopped it before any change — a fix for a race that does not happen is worse than the mails.

**The ceremony now says what already works** — `docs/SHIP-CEREMONY.md` step 12. Followed in list
order the ceremony **could not** produce a green push run: CI reaches Rule B ~13 s after the push
while step 10 waits minutes. Step 12's wording now says the sweep happens **immediately after the
push in step 9**. Nothing moved, nothing renumbered — the numbers are load-bearing in five
`check-tags.mjs` sites.

**Everything the recent runs named and left is cleared** —
[LEFTOVERS-1](../reports/evolution/LEFTOVERS-1.md). Twelve stale code addresses in `docs/`, the two
remaining ship-order drifts, the two-lists-both-reach-12 trap, the `workflow_dispatch` caveat, the
three gaps between a green branch and a green CI, and the open list below.

---

## RUNNING

**`feat/playable-four-1` — four pieces, one branch, NO MERGE PERMISSION.** Piece **A** (the comeback
measurement) is **done and pushed**. Pieces **B** (Cancel Race), **C** (server-gone banner and
fallback) and **D** (a short race identifier) follow in that order; if time runs short the fall order
is C then B. Nothing on the branch is minted, and no fingerprint has moved.

---

## OPEN

**Checked against the tree on 2026-09-05 before being listed. The full version with source addresses
is in [BACKLOG.md § WHAT IS ACTUALLY OPEN](BACKLOG.md); this is the short form.**

- **Cancel Race** — not in the client at all. The fullscreen half of PR-G is wired.
- **TLH-3** — `defaultTracks.js` does not exist; no status banner. Deferred by its own entry.
- **A short race identifier to replace the seed** — your decision of 2026-09-05 (**D33**). The seed
  fixes the plan but not the world; config is read from the host's storage at race start, so one seed
  on two machines is two races. **Not designed.**
- **The comeback BEATS reaching the camera** — **MEASURED (piece A above); the decision is now
  yours.** Passing the beats through was deliberately NOT built. What the measurement gives you: the
  camera never picks the wrong racer, and is early every single time by a median 9.90 s.
- **★ NEW, from piece A: the harness camera is not the browser camera for the comeback shot.** The
  shared driver hard-codes `isOutcomePhase: false`; only `camera-replay.mjs` does it the browser's
  way. **The camera fingerprint is taken with that window closed.** Nothing was changed — it is
  recorded so it is not re-discovered.
- **The missing `routing.mjs` guard** — nothing checks that a guard's dynamic-import literals are
  inside its own resolved set. The property holds **by inspection, not by construction**.
- **`lint` and `format:check` are not in `verify`** — it runs the formatter, not a check. CI runs
  all three; `verify` runs none of them.
- **Deployment** — see NEEDS HIS WORD.

**Not on this list, because the tree says they are done:** piece **D** (the item-7 gap) — closed by
ITEM7-MEMBERSHIP-1, item 7 reads 0 of 80. The **closing-phase cut** — already built, D32. The
**deployed client's API address** — decided, D30 chose runtime resolution; the *build* is part of
deployment below.

---

## NEEDS HIS WORD

**One item — and one branch.**

★ **THE BRANCH FIRST: `feat/playable-four-1` is at origin, unmerged, and pieces B, C and D on it
change what you see.** They are built for your eye before anything lands. At the end of the chain
the dev server is put on that branch so you can look at all three without doing anything.

~~**MAY THE RENDER FINGERPRINT BE RE-MINTED?**~~ **ANSWERED — you ordered it, and it is minted.**
MINT-RENDER-1 re-measured the value on the tree master took before writing anything, and the other
three roles were re-measured in the same pass and are unmoved. The value lives in
[fingerprints.json](fingerprints.json) and nowhere else. What the mint did **not** close is written
beside it: text measurement in the recorder is synthetic, so the hash pins the tag-layout RULE and
not the name-versus-number count you actually see on screen.

**So one question stands, and it is the one that was already here. Every other item that stood in
this section has been answered.**

1. **Deployment — a domain, which reverse proxy terminates TLS, and where the data lives.**
   **The server has no TLS at all** — searched for, not assumed — and that is a design decision
   rather than an omission: it sets `trust proxy` and issues `__Host-` Secure cookies, expecting a
   terminator in front. **D30 already chose HOW the client finds the API** (resolve at start time,
   so one image works at any address) **and that change is not built** — it is its own block, and it
   waits on these three answers.

**Answered since this sheet was last written, and struck for that reason:**
~~Does the acceptance reach gate item 2?~~ **D27 — yes**, and the sheet now says so itself.
~~Is 27 MB of `date-fns` worth it?~~ **D29 — it stays.**
~~What should the deployed client's API address be?~~ **D30 — resolved at start time.**
~~Does the closing phase end a battle shot too?~~ **D28 — yes**, and the premise it rested on was
withdrawn; the cut itself turned out to be **already in the tree** (D32).
